# Bedwars Mod
A Forge 1.8.9 Hypixel Mod to add QOL and stats features to Hypixel Bedwars.

### Quick Message
This mod has been inspired by a previous Bedwars utility mod by CalMWolfs that you can find [here](https://modrinth.com/mod/bedwar-mod). The plan for this project is to eventually add the majority of features seen in CalMWolfs' mod, but with improved functionality and more uses. I'm still working to implement a lot of these features and highly recommend you use CalMWolfs' mod until this mod has reached a stable release.
